                Windows: Rather than opening Notepad, going to the File menu to save it, then browsing to a specific
                folder, you
                can more quickly create a text file in your chosen folder by right-clicking then hitting W and then T.
                The right-click > W > T shortcut eliminates the need to open Notepad first. It will create a text
                document ready
                for file naming and then all you have to do is hit Enter to open the text document for editing (hit
                CTRL+S to
                save your changes and you've got a very streamlined text-document-creating workflow).
                Shortcut ninja Adam Pash uses this all the time to create text docs everywhere, but I learned this trick
                from
                Lifehacker reader KayDat in last week's Alt+double-click shortcut thread (thanks, KayDat!). What are

                A text file (sometimes spelled textfile; an old alternative name is flatfile) is a kind of computer <img
                    src="images/backgroundimg.jpg" class="alingIn slideIn img1"> file
                structured as a sequence of lines of electronic text. A text file exists stored as data within a
                that is
                computer file
                system. In operating systems such as CP/M and MS-DOS, where the operating system does not keep track of
                the file
                size in bytes, the end of a text file is denoted by placing one or more special characters, known as an
                end-of-file marker, as padding after the last line in a text file. On modern operating systems such as
                Microsoft
                Windows and Unix-like systems, text files do not contain any special EOF character, because file systems
                on
                those operating systems keep track of the file size in bytes. There are for most text files a need to
                have
                end-of-line delimiters, which are done in a few different ways depending on operating system. Some
                operating
                systems with record-orientated file systems may not use new line delimiters and will primarily store
                text files
                with lines separated as fixed or variable length records.
                "Text file" refers to a type of container, while plain text refers to a type of content. Text files can
                contain
                plain text, but they are not limited to such
